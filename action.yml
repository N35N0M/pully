  PULLY_SLACK_TOKEN:
    description: The slack app token that has chat:write access only to the channel it is added to

  POST_INITIAL_DRAFT:
    description: If set to any value (we dont have boolean types in reusable actions?), it will post to slack when the draft is made. Elsewise it will not post before being marked ready for review

  PULLY_HIDE_REPOSITORY_OWNER_IN_SLACK_MESSAGE:
